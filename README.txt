Requires:
 - Nodejs
 - npm
 - .env file (this contains username and password)

To run:
1. Unzip to your desire directory.
2. Run "npm install" from index.js directory. 
	Note: Existence of node_modules folder in the same directory means that installation of dependencies are done.
3. Run index.js  (I would advise you to also use 'pm2' to keep the app running in the background).
	Note: "npm install pm2"
